# Word Guessing Game Consolidation Project 

# Program function
- This is a two player game 
- There is a secret word that the players will have to guess from the word bank 
- Each player has a turn (it will alternate each time a player guesses)
- The program will track how many letter guesses each player makes
- Each player has a maximum of 3 wrong guesses, they will lose the game if they reached 3 wrong guesses
- The program will not tell the player the position of the letters in the word 
- The game will end if a player guesses the word 
- The secret word is worth 5 points 
- Once the game finishes it will display the final scores for each player 
- The game will announce the winner 
- A chart will be displayed to show the final score for each player using Matplotlib
- The game will record the game statistics such as the players, scores, and number of wrong guesses
- My partner Zohair Farouk help contribute with this game.
